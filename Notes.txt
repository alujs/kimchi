Tasklist: 
[] Splash Page
[x] Server side monster scaling 
   [x] Should increase over time in numbers
   [x] Should not spawn in walls or water
   [x] Should increase in speed and strength as well as score
   [x] Sound track based on difficulty
     - Wesker's Theme - speed increase, damge increase
     - Sacred War - health decrease, massive numbers, slow movement
     - Cat Groove - everything, double spiders.
[] Distance based sound - another player's machine gun fire should sound off
[] Some way to display final score

[] Smooth the sync transition; it's a bit too jagged. Only sync up those things that are not within 5. 
[] Spawn spider mob - have it fire speed debuffing shots. Instead of setting speed,
   on the player and resetting it, just subtract. 
[] Load Test
