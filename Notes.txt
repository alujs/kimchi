How can I fix the AI? 


Periodically get three seed values and put that in for the determine? 

AI must behave deterministically.

How do I resync? Take a snapshot of the game at a random interval, and ask all clients to resync 

ToDo: 
[] Finish utilities
   [x] Should nuke a room
   [] Should properly spawn mobs
   [] Should properly record health etc. 
[] Clear up player movement
   [x] Has smoother animations
   [] Needs a bit more clean up 
   [] Need to spawn according to server Instructions
[] Utilize cookies
   [] Players should be spawned based on what the cookie says
[] Resyncing
   [] Should resync

var resync = function() {
	// randomly selects two clients that aren't being culled
	// Asks them for an array of their entities. 
	// chooses one of them as the game state 
	// sends a signal to all zombies to resync. 
};



var seeds = function() {
	// takes a bunch of random values
	// seeds an array and sends it to the AI , the AI then uses the array
	// all new things will be initialized using that array. 
	// feeds it into the client
   // everything is done in order
  
};


var nukeRoom = function() {
	// if a room has zero users, write the scores to the profile
    // drop the room from database
};

var gameOver = function() {
	// Check to see if all the players are dead
	// redirect page or show a pop up
	// call nukeRoom 
};

var killPlayer = function() {
	
};
