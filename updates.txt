-I FREAKIN accidently overwrote the animation file in media and didn't have a back up for it. Well I do, but it's the one that doesn't work properly, I fixed it all up and spend awhile on it too and now I have ot do it all over again. Anyways, don't mind it, i"ll take care of it.


AI.JS

- I was thinking about it, and instead of having a decision, we can set a timer instead, and have the zombie attack once every (certain amount of time) like I did with the bullet fire. Then the zombie doesn't have to make a decision, AND it also doesn't make it so that the zombie doesn't attack ridiculously fast.

ENEMY2.JS

-Spiders shoot acid
-Animations are not perfected yet.

AI.JS

-enemies do not randomly make decisons to attack anymore, instead they attack every 2 seconds.
